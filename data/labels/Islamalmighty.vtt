00:00.000 --> 00:24.000
They ask can you have it all, faith and gold

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
But my pain is rich, my story is bold

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
From scholars and kings to the traders who've thrived

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
With Islam in my heart I learn and I rise

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Faith in my heart, a mindset to grow

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
Building my dreams with the seeds that I sow

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
I can be wise, I can be strong

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Being Muslim won't hold me back at all

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
I am Muslim, I stand tall

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Success and faith, I claim them all

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
With God as my guide and love in my soul

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
There are no limits, I'm reaching my goal

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
When Europe was lost in shadows so deep

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
We lit up the world, gave knowledge to keep

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Our quarries mirror numbers that shaped every trade

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
I've seen our healed hearts with the sign team made

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
From Baghdad to Spain, our wisdom would shine

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Libraries, medicine, art so divine

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
We built the foundation for futures untold

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
While the world was in darkness, I'm rushing to go

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
Faith in my heart, a mindset to grow

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
Building my dreams with the seeds that I sow

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
I can be wise, I can be strong

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Being Muslim won't hold me back at all

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
I am Muslim, I stand tall

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Success and faith, I claim them all

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
With God as my guide and love in my soul

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
There are no limits, I'm reaching my goal

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
It all can be done, with more faith than you've got

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
In yourself and the people you love

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
So walk with pride, stand up tall

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
You can have it, yes you can have it all
