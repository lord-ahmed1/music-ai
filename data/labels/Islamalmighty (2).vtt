00:00.000 --> 00:26.640
They ask, can you have it all, faith and gold

00:26.800 --> 00:31.040
But my gene is rich, my story is bold

00:31.040 --> 00:35.600
From scholars and kings to the traders who thrive

00:35.600 --> 00:40.560
With Islam in my heart, I learn and I rise

00:40.560 --> 00:45.680
Faith in my heart, a mindset to grow

00:45.680 --> 00:49.600
Building my dreams with the seeds that I sow

00:49.600 --> 00:52.240
I can be wise, I can be strong

00:52.240 --> 00:56.160
Being Muslim won't hold me back at all

00:56.160 --> 01:00.960
I am Muslim, I stand tall

01:00.960 --> 01:06.160
Success and faith, I claim that I'm all

01:06.160 --> 01:11.440
With God as my guide and love in my soul

01:11.440 --> 01:16.640
There are no limits, I'm reaching my goal

01:16.640 --> 01:21.520
When Europe was lost in shadows so deep

01:21.600 --> 01:27.040
We lit up the world, gave knowledge to keep

01:27.040 --> 01:31.600
El Chorus near old numbers that shaped every trade

01:31.600 --> 01:36.160
I am seen that healed hearts with the science it made

01:36.160 --> 01:40.800
From Baghdad to Spain, our ways done would shine

01:40.800 --> 01:45.280
Libraries, medicine, art so divine

01:45.280 --> 01:49.280
We built a foundation for futures untold

01:49.280 --> 01:53.520
While the world was in darkness, our minds turned to gold

01:53.520 --> 01:57.360
Faith in my heart, a mindset to grow

01:57.360 --> 02:00.000
Building my dreams with the seeds that I sow

02:00.000 --> 02:02.560
I can be wise, I can be strong

02:02.560 --> 02:06.560
Being Muslim won't hold me back at all

02:06.560 --> 02:11.440
I am Muslim, I stand tall

02:11.440 --> 02:16.640
Success and faith, I claim that I'm all

02:16.720 --> 02:21.920
With God as my guide and love in my soul

02:21.920 --> 02:27.120
There are no limits, I'm reaching my goal

02:27.120 --> 02:31.200
When Europe was lost in shadows so deep
